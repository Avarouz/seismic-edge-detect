# Seismic Edge Detection

A research project exploring whether edge detection models can identify seismic activity in large waveform datasets. This includes adapting and testing image-based edge detection architectures (such as TEED) on seismic data.

## Goals
- Apply and evaluate edge detection models on seismic datasets.
- Investigate whether visual edge patterns correlate with seismic events.
- Develop preprocessing pipelines to convert waveform data into image-compatible formats.
